# Development Environment Status

## Current State (2025-07-26)

### Services Status
- ✅ Backend: Running and healthy (ports 3001-3002)
- ✅ Frontend: Running but marked unhealthy due to ESLint warnings (port 3010)
- ✅ PostgreSQL: Healthy (port 5432)
- ✅ Elasticsearch: Healthy (port 9200)
- ✅ Redis: Healthy (port 6379)
- ✅ Varnish Stats: Running

### Known Issues

1. **Frontend Health Check**: Container marked unhealthy due to ESLint warnings, but the application is functional
   - Unused variables in AdminView.js and BrowserView.js
   - Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks

2. **Backend Workers**: Health check reports "cacheManager.getWorkersStatus is not a function" but cache functionality works

3. **Environment Variables**: LUCIDLINK_REST_ENDPOINT warning appears but doesn't affect functionality

### Recent Fixes Applied
- ✅ Media preview endpoints now support all file types (video, image, audio)
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates fixed for cache jobs and network stats
- ✅ Development environment uses correct ports and configurations
- ✅ Database authentication working with hardcoded dev credentials
- ✅ Terminal functionality restored with node-pty

### Configuration Notes
- Development mode uses `.env.development.local` for overrides
- Default admin credentials: admin/admin123
- Frontend dev server: http://localhost:3010
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- WebSocket: ws://localhost:3002

### Next Steps
- Consider fixing ESLint warnings to resolve frontend health check
- Investigate workers status function in backend health check
- Media preview Redis caching between requests still has issues but endpoints work
