This is a placeholder for lucidlink_3.2.6817_amd64.deb

For development without the actual LucidLink binary, this placeholder prevents Docker build failures.

To use LucidLink functionality:
1. Download lucidlink_3.2.6817_amd64.deb from the official LucidLink website
2. Place it in this backend/ directory  
3. Remove this placeholder file
4. Rebuild the Docker containers

The application will still function for file browsing without LucidLink.
